## Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This project documents my journey in learning machine learning, exploring various approaches to model training. I began with linear regression and polynomial models, then progressed to building neural networks using sigmoid functions and deep learning techniques. Additionally, I applied optimization strategies such as gradient descent and Adagrad to improve model performance.

## Topics
**Linear Regression**
```
model: y = b + wx
loss function: (y - (b + m * x)) ** 2
```
**Deep Learning**
```
model: sigmoid function
y: true value
y': predicted value
loss function: abs(y - y')
```
**Gradient Descent**

Optimize b(bias) and w(weight) to minimize loss.
